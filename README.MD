BTCDAO

July 12 2021

This document hereby establishes a worldwide digital autonomous organization
(DAO) known as BTCDAO.

## Abstract

Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus has created a new epoch in energy production.
Stranded energy, such as geothermal and hydroelectric, can power Bitcoin mining
operations and the profits can help finance infrastructure to bridge the stranded
energy to areas that can use it.

Furthermore, nations have begun selling bonds to bootstrap energy production and
mining operations within their borders. These bonds will be paid with interest
from the mining profits. Because Bitcoin is a deflationary asset, the bonds are
a reasonably secure investment. There is a very high probability that a successful
mining operation would generate enough Bitcoin to repay bond holders. However,
trust in the bond issuer is a risk.

While it is very exciting that Bitcoin has unlocked a whole new opportunity for
growth within countries that have stranded energy, there is an even larger
opportunity at hand.

There are 2 problems BTCDAO proposes to solve:

1. Trust in bond issuers is required to have financial exposure to stranded energy
mining (SEM).
2. Nations must currently innovate SEM solutions in isolation. Few Nations have
implemented SEM.

Rather than leaving each country to figure out how to monetize stranded energy
for themselves, BTCDAO proposes the following:

1. Work with the global community to create an open-source blueprint for unlocking
stranded energy via Bitcoin mining.
2. Work with the global community to create a trustless Bitcoin-based bond
mechanism whereby nations can raise Bitcoin anonymously from the global community
to fund the implementation of this blueprint, and funders can receieve a return on
their Bitcoin from profitable SEM.
3. Initiate and operate BTCDAO SEM operations across the planet according to this
blueprint.

BTCDAO's purpose is to facilitate, initiate and support stranded energy mining (SEM)
operations across the globe. The purpose of these mining operations is to benefit
the local communities, local governments, DAO participants, and the world at large.

This initiative will:
- increase clean energy availability worldwide
- enrich developing nations and the individual bond holders who support them
- create a clear path to SEM for nations and organizations
- accelerate geothermal and hydroelectric power generation technology development
- create a collaborative worldwide culture of self-sufficiency, responsiblity, and
sovereignty
- create borderless investment opportunities without sacrificing privacy 
- bring jobs to jobless areas
- share knowledge across borders that might otherwise not be shared
- bring Bitcoin and its principles to every corner of the world

## Objectives

In the full spirit of free and open source software, this document aims to
establish a vision for DAO-directed volcanic Bitcoin mining and its impact on
the world as well as an archetype for repeatable implementation that can be
applied where needed by whomever needs it, be they other DAOs, individuals,
companies, or nations. This document is published under the MIT License, see
/LICENSE.

## Mission

The principles of Bitcoin are the foundation and litmus for all of the DAO's
operations and participants. BTCDAO's mission is to execute global initiatives
that grow and secure human sovereignty by fully and perpetually aligning its
values and incentives with that of Bitcoin.

## Structure

This RFC has been posted to a public repository on github.com to facilitate
public discussion, transparency, and collaboration. All people of good will are
invited to become part of BTCDAO and contribute to the construction of a better
world. Currently, this repository is owned by an individual. The goal is to move
away from this centralized control as quickly as possible with the help of BTCDAO
participants.

At the moment, one can become a participant in BTCDAO by interacting with this
repository, whether by providing feedback, starring/watching, contributing or
opening an issue. Membership confers no benefits at this time, but the structure
of the DAO will evolve with community input.

The organizational structure and governance structure of BTCDAO are yet to be
determined; using Bitcoin core development as an archetype, input from the
worldwide Bitcoin community will be crucial in establishing the appropriate
organizational structure and governance structure. These structures will likely
evolve over time as necessary.

Nakamoto Consensus and the Bitcoin network itself could be instrumental in
implementing a global decentralized governance structure for BTCDAO, but the
specific parameters of such governance must still be defined.

# Blueprint for Stranded Energy Mining (SEM)

## Modules

A module is a BTCDAO-run stranded energy Bitcoin mining operation at a specific
location. The impact of a module includes:

- the construction of new geothermal power plants
- the construction of new power grid infrastructure that integrates with
existing local infrastructure
- energy output that is sold to local power grids at a perpetual discount to
encourage economic growth in the local region
- the hiring, training, and retention of local and remote labor to operate the
module
- local community outreach efforts to promote and facilitate education on
Bitcoin and individual sovereignty
- taxes paid to local government for ongoing module operations
- increased local economic activity thanks to module operations
- revenue paid to BTCDAO participants from mining operations
- various local philanthropic endeavors and investments to be determined on a
case-by-case basis by BTCDAO

## Investment

BTCDAO participants may invest Bitcoin with BTCDAO in a trustless fashion to
fund new modules. Investors will be repayed according to their investment
amount from the module's mining profits.
