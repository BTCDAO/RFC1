# RFC1

BTCDAO

July 12 2021

This document hereby establishes a worldwide digital autonomous organization
(DAO) known as BTCDAO.

## Abstract

Bitcoin's proof-of-work consensus has created a new epoch in energy production.
Stranded energy can power Bitcoin mining operations and the profits can help
finance infrastructure to bridge the stranded energy to areas that can use it.

Furthermore, nations have begun selling bonds to bootstrap energy production and
mining operations within their borders. These bonds will be paid with interest
from the mining profits. Because Bitcoin is a deflationary asset, the bonds are
a reasonably secure investment. There is a very high probability that a successful
mining operation would generate enough Bitcoin to repay bond holders. However,
trust in the bond issuer is a risk.

While it is very exciting that Bitcoin has unlocked a whole new opportunity for
growth within countries that have stranded energy, there is an even larger
opportunity at hand.

Rather than leaving each country to figure out how to monetize stranded energy
for themselves, BTCDAO proposes the following:

1. Work with the global community to create an open-source blueprint for unlocking
stranded energy via Bitcoin mining.
2. Work with the global community to create a trustless bond mechanism on the
Bitcoin network whereby nations can raise Bitcoin to fund the implementation of the
blueprint and funders can receieve a return on their Bitcoin.

BTCDAO's purpose is to initiate and support volcanic Bitcoin mining operations
across the globe. The purpose of these mining operations is to benefit the local
communities, local governments, DAO participants, and the world at large.

## Objectives

In the full spirit of free and open source software, this document aims to
establish a vision for DAO-directed volcanic Bitcoin mining and its impact on
the world as well as an archetype for repeatable implementation that can be
applied where needed by whomever needs it, be they other DAOs, individuals,
companies, or nations. This document is published under the MIT License, see
/LICENSE.

## Mission

The principles of Bitcoin are the foundation and litmus for all of the DAO's
operations and participants. BTCDAO's mission is to execute global initiatives
that grow and secure human sovereignty by fully and perpetually aligning its
values and incentives with that of Bitcoin.

## Structure

This RFC has been posted to a public repository on github.com to facilitate
public discussion, transparency, and collaboration. All people of good will are
invited to become part of BTCDAO and contribute to the construction of a better
world.

The organizational structure and governance structure of BTCDAO are yet to be
determined; using Bitcoin core development as an archetype, input from the
worldwide Bitcoin community will be crucial in establishing the appropriate
organizational structure and governance structure. These structures will likely
evolve over time as necessary.

Nakamoto Consensus and the Bitcoin network itself could be instrumental in
implementing a global decentralized governance structure for BTCDAO, but the
specific parameters of such governance must still be defined.

Currently, this repository is owned by an individual. The goal is to move away
from this centralized control as quickly as possible with the help of BTCDAO
participants.

# Modules

A module is a BTCDAO-run volcanic Bitcoin mining operation at a specific
location. The impact of a module includes:

- the construction of new geothermal power plants
- the construction of new power grid infrastructure that integrates with
existing local infrastructure
- energy output that is sold to local power grids at a perpetual discount to
encourage economic growth in the local region
- the hiring, training, and retention of local and remote labor to operate the
module
- local community outreach efforts to promote and facilitate education on
Bitcoin and individual sovereignty
- taxes paid to local government for ongoing module operations
- increased local economic activity thanks to module operations
- revenue paid to BTCDAO participants from mining operations
- various local philanthropic endeavors and investments to be determined on a case-by-case basis by BTCDAO

## Investment

BTCDAO participants may invest Bitcoin with BTCDAO to fund new modules.
Investors will be repayed according to their investment amount from the module's
mining profits.
